The cook recommended using oyster sauce.  He assured viewers that is doesn't taste like oysters.  It is a \"yumcious\", slightly thick, salty brown sauce. The background flavor is unidentifiable - it doesn't taste like chicken, lamb, beef, etc. It is something else but in the same meat family, not in the seafood family.  I used it on a wild rice stir fry.  I used about a tablespoon for 1.5 cups of rice.  It was delicious!  Next time though I will use a slightly smaller amount as I don't use a lot of salt on my food.  When you go to a Chinese restaurant and dishes are presented with a brown sauce that is indescribably delicious, I think that oyster sauce must be the base.  I'd always wondered how they made the sauce.  Secret uncovered - it's oyster sauce.
