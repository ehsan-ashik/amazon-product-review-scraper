Walmart has Oyster Sauce in a tiny little bottle for like $5 - we can use that up in a week. Saw this on Amazon. Kikkoman is trusted brand, but I've never tried their Oyster Sauce before. It's Good.

15,B00842LTE2,Kikkoman Oyster Flavored Sauce-Red Label,oyester_sauce,4.6,taste,5.0,"September 30, 2022",United States,This is Tasty Sauce!,"I saw a YouTube video on making fried rice.  The cook recommended using oyster sauce.  He assured viewers that is doesn't taste like oysters.  It is a ""yumcious"", slightly thick, salty brown sauce. The background flavor is unidentifiable - it doesn't taste like chicken, lamb, beef, etc. It is something else but in the same meat family, not in the seafood family.  I used it on a wild rice stir fry.  I used about a tablespoon for 1.5 cups of rice.  It was delicious!  Next time though I will use a slightly smaller amount as I don't use a lot of salt on my food.  When you go to a Chinese restaurant and dishes are presented with a brown sauce that is indescribably delicious, I think that oyster sauce must be the base.  I'd always wondered how they made the sauce.  Secret uncovered - it's oyster sauce.  My husband has the palate of an 8 year old boy - meat and potatoes - he loved the chicken piece I made him try :)",5

There is nothing artificial or flavor enhancers in this...unless if you consider yeast to be a flavor enhancer.  Tasty!!It is difficult if not impossible to find oyster sauce or any oriental sauces that doesn't have flavor enhancers or msg, or stuff like gum and preservatives... totally unnecessary and make the sauce feel tacky and taste tacky.
